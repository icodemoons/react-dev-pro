            I specialize in helping brands,small businesses, and people alike with their e-commerce stores by taking their vision and turning it into a thriving reality. I have worked with a variety of clients, such as lawyers, interior designers, accountants, health companies, celebrities, hotels, start ups and airports. During this time, it was some of the most challenging but rewarding work I have ever done. I enjoy the challenge of working with various types of people and companies as I find it to be rewarding.
            <br /><br />

            I grew up entertaining and performing in which I had the privilege to DJ, breakdance, and host events nationwide. I had the opportunity to work with celebrities and performed as a breakdancer at parties such as Ultra Music Festival in Miami, FL, and Austin City Limits in Austin, TX. My life quickly changed when my dance partner passed away. In 2014, I met an entrepreneurial friend that helped me pivot my life.
            <br /><br />

            He ran a boutique business and web development agency. Right away I was immersed in a world of creativity, business development, marketing, and growth hacking- you name it and we did it! We wore many many hats and had lots of challenges. There was a year when my friend was in and out of the hospital and I had to hold it down, otherwise, we would have lost momentum. So, that meant me getting out of my comfort zone. It was a difficult year but we pulled through with our two-man team. When my friend's father passed from being exposed to a bad chemical, my friend and I used our strengths, and our commitment to create a health and wellness company. It has been successful and is now expanding globally.

            I know that I will bring my versitallity, passion, kindness and creativity and the best of me to the role I am applying for or another that you might feel is a better fit.
