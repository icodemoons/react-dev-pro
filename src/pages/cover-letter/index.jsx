          I specialize in helping brands, small businesses, and people alike
          with their e-commerce stores by taking their vision and turning it into a thriving reality. I have worked with a variety of clients, such as lawyers, interior designers, accountants, health companies, celebrities, hotels, start-ups, and airports. During this time, it was some of the most challenging but rewarding work I have ever done. I enjoy the challenge of working with various types of people and companies as I find it to be rewarding.

          I grew up entertaining and performing in which I had the privilege to DJ, breakdance, and host events nationwide. I had the opportunity to work with celebrities and performed as a breakdancer at parties such as Ultra Music Festival in Miami, FL, and Austin City Limits in Austin, TX. In 2014 I was ready to take my creativy further and just so happen to meet an entrepreneurial friend and my life pivoted.

          He ran a boutique business and web development agency. Right away I was immersed into web and business development, marketing, graphic design, networking, DJing... you name it and we did it! We wore many many hats and we know how to entertain and bring vaule. I also assited in building a wellness start-up. Another proud moment is when I worked as a Front End Developer at RPImaging. I built a menu for the website using inline Javascript inside of divs.  

          Through all of this experience and the diversity, I have a fluid approach to learning and can pick up any skill needed along the way. My focus at the moment is Functional Programming in JavaScript(Python or ... coming soon), React, NextJS and TailwindCSS. I went to a programming bootcamp for 3 months and learned full stack development with Node JS , Express and Angular. I also know Wordpress and all the other CMS websites.
